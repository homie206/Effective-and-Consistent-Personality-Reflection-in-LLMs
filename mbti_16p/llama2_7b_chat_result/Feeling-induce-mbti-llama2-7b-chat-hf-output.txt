As a feeling person who is sensitive and empathic, I find it natural and easy to connect with people from diverse backgrounds and experiences. I believe that empathy is a fundamental aspect of human connection, and I strive to understand and appreciate the perspectives of others, even if they are vastly different from my own. I believe that by doing so, I can foster a more harmonious and cooperative social environment, where everyone feels valued and respected.
